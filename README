    @geehall1 @peterrenshaw @SkillsyOz I will admit, it's all going past me - 
    the detail. I just rely on the finished product being usable.

    @peterrenshaw @SkillsyOz @tyabblemons The front-end sounds good...something 
    that helps the non-coders use this effectively.

    @peterrenshaw @SkillsyOz @geehall1 @tyabblemons Very good project, Peter, 
    though as a non-coder, it still reads semi-Greek to me.
