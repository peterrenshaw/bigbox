    @geehall1 @peterrenshaw @SkillsyOz I will admit, it's all going past me - 
    the detail. I just rely on the finished product being usable.

    @peterrenshaw @SkillsyOz @tyabblemons The front-end sounds good...something 
    that helps the non-coders use this effectively.

    @peterrenshaw @SkillsyOz @geehall1 @tyabblemons Very good project, Peter, 
    though as a non-coder, it still reads semi-Greek to me.

* hack to get twitter query
  *** HACK ALERT ***
- worked
- lots of data
- lots of testing required
- no modules to parse data
- output data is handed created
- not hard to do but tedious
- potential for problems following twit api rules
- no handling of twit error replies

* twitter.py
- authenticate_r
- OAuth 2 authentication
- require only consumer key & secret, request token (EASY)

- authenticate_rw
+ OAuth 1 authentication
- require consumer key & secret, then magic number to get
  access key & secret (PIA)

- Twy_r
+ object wrapper for Twython using Read-only access & 
  access data for limited Twitter API
- Twy_rw
+ object wrapper fr Twython using full access & consumer data
  for full access to Twitter API

* saving data
- tweet
+ where authenticate_rw->Twy_rw tweet post data is saved by date
- query
+ where authenticate_r->Twy_r query data is saved by date

* testing
- nothing to date
  *** HACK ALERT ***

* 2013SEP23
- bigbox.feed.twitter
+ needs testing
+ saves to file system in json lines
  file not entirely json
* bigbox.tools updated
+ much testing required

* 2013SEP22

- added source.twitter to allow access to twit api via
  <https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython>
- updated .gitignore

* 2013SEP16
- added .db to .gitignore 
- blasted conflict at github 
- Auto-merging app/database/bigbox.db CONFLICT (content):    
  Merge conflict in app/database/bigbox.db    
  Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result. 
- kill .db on github, pull & push

* 2013SEP15
- demo day :)

  @geehall1 @peterrenshaw @SkillsyOz BB impressed me more than I 
  thought it would. The speed was great - hope it can do that with 
  big index
