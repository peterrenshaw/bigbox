       More hacking of words and process stuff in D3.js :)


Had some food and decided to process the text and see what would happen to the text. The above image is post processed text. Is there any difference between this image and the previous?

Here’s the original text I used:

    ⌨ bigbox
    bb is … ? bigbox
    … !bigbird, bb is ?
    bigbox
    … !brigitte bardot?
    bigbox
    bb isn’t BB King :(
    bb is literally, ‘… a box & a buffer’, a big box.
    bigbox
    is about ‘local’ search & storage because:

    users are considered ☠
    the cloud is ☢
    say ✖ to spying… :)
    programmers ♥ complex things, users simplicity. bb is about ‘simplicity’ and… ‘speed’ users want this…
    but end up with this…
    is this fast enough? bb is about ‘speed’ & …
    bb is about text :)
    & processing text …
    bb is about manipulating data
    … lots of data …
    bb is about ‘sharing’…
    bb is all about will be about sharing data …
    bb is about ‘search’
    bb is about searching ‘locally’ & on the ‘Internet’ …
    bb is a “tool” and work is ongoing
    more hacking is needed …
    bb is a “open source”…

    ⌨ bigbox
    bb is a “open source”…
    opensource
    gpl3.0:
    you can view it
    download it
    add to it
    an “elegant solution”…
    from a more civilised time …
    summary: bb is?

This is messy, so I hacked a quick program that you can find here and processed the text so it looks like this:
