  desc BIGBOX: A easy to use front end for socsim. This 
       hack, BIGBOX search allows for search within or external 
       to you local system.

abstract

        A simple search form for N, where N is something to search. A search
	could be externally for twitter or a search engine. Search could be
	offline and be something local.

        The story so far with duckduckgo search. It's good.


The story so far.

I want to use the Duckduckgo Instant answers API to grab information
from the Internet but the code that's available isn't suitable. So 
I've been writing a replacement.


I have a module to query duckduckgo using a search key. It returns a
json object filled with data from that search OR nothing.

    duckduckgo.Duckduckgo()


With this module I can save the data extracted to a simple text file 
filled with json. So far so good.


But we can't read JSON easily. I need a way to extract the data from 
the JSON file to be readable. So I wrote a module that extracts the 
data from the JSON module. You could do anything with this data, send
it as a tweet; cut+paste it; store in a database. I chose to save it
as a text file.

This is a good process.

* query ddg with a search key
* retreive the ddg JSON data
* save the JSON data to a text file
* read the text file and extract the data
* save the extracted data to another file.


This can be simplified as 

    Query
    Retrieve data
    Save to file
    Read file at later date
    Extrct from file useful data
    Save extacted data


Now lets do this using a query. Lets go...

    python query.py -q 'neil young' -e -k -d -j -p -r 
                    -f /path/to/file/neilyoung.json


This query does a lot of things. Forget the switches for the 
moment. Concentrate instead on what's happening.
       
    Process  key                           switch
    Query    'neil young'                  -q
    Extract  JSON to text                  -e
    Save     /path/2file/neilyoung.json    -s
   


Easy to read?  Lets make it easier. Here is a fragment, 


  {
   "Definition" : "He began his career as a folksinger in 
                   Winnipeg and later moved to Los Angeles, 
                   Calif., U.S., where he formed the rock 
                   group Buffalo Springfield with Stephen 
                   Stills.",
   "DefinitionSource" : "",
   "Heading" : "Neil Young",
   "AbstractSource" : "Wikipedia",
   "Image" : "https://i.duckduckgo.com/i/617d287f.jpg",
   "RelatedTopics" : [
      {
         "Result" : "<a href=\"http://duckduckgo.com/d/Neil_Young\">Neil Young Meanings</a>",
         "Icon" : {
            "URL" : "",
            "Height" : "",
            "Width" : ""
         },
         "FirstURL" : "http://duckduckgo.com/d/Neil_Young",
         "Text" : "Neil Young Meanings"
      },
      {
         "Result" : "<a href=\"http://duckduckgo.com/c/Neil_Young\">Neil Young Category</a>",
         "Icon" : {
            "URL" : "",
            "Height" : "",
            "Width" : ""
         },
         "FirstURL" : "http://duckduckgo.com/c/Neil_Young",
         "Text" : "Neil Young Category"
      },

 
This gives us some JSON. Hard to read by people, easier in software. Our 
objective is to store as human readable text. Now lets do some 
extraction...

    python query.py -k -f /path/2file/ny.json > neilyoung.txt
 

Here's what is going on:
       
    Process      key                       switch
    cache                                  -k
    read        /path/2file/neilyoung.json -f
   
Now we've done some tricky things. We haven't queried ddg on the Internet.
We are reading from a file. In fact we now have a primative database of 
sorts. A discrete query saved with a unique name. This is good. It not 
only speeds things up but reduces the hit on the Duckduckgo API. 

There's one last detail. 

I havent't written a save the extracted data so I'm sending the data to a
new text file to read. This is called re-direction. It's the same as saveing
a file. It wouldn't be hard to do this. I'm just saving time.


Now what do we have? 

  We have the original query:                   "neil young'     Interet
  We have a query response as a file:           'neilyoung.json' file
  We have an extracted data from the json file, 'neilyoung.txt'. file


We can now load this data and re-use it any way we like and for bigbox this
is good. I've controlled all this output. It's quite possible to manipulate
the data shown here with a great degree of granularity. This is what the 
results from ny.txt looks like:

    reading </media/S/code/bigbox/tools/neilyoung.json> from cache...
