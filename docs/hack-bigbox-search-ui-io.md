    desc BIGBOX: A easy to use front end for socsim. This 
         hack, BIGBOX search allows for search within or 
	 external to you local system.


## Abstract

    Why code duckduckgo when there's a perfectly good bit of
existing code that can do the job?


### New over old

I want some kind of basic search interaction on a local client tool
I'm working and so I looked for existing code to do this. It wasn't hard, 
the Duckduckgo instant answers API has quite a collection of code to do this.
So I downloaded the code, played with it for a while.

* Python 3
* Testing
* Request
