abstract

       Hack words and process stuff in D3.js :)

Lets have another go at describing Bigbox.

For a talk I did a couple of weeks ago (yet to upload, do this plz), I did an 
18 page html description of Bigbox.  Now if I gave you a quick glimpse of the 
page I think it’d give you a good idea of what I described bb? What about if 
you have little time? How do I describe what bb is to someone quickly? Looking 
for way so describe information through images is one way. So how might I find 
another way to describe Bigbox quickly?

One idea could be to build a word cloud using the data captured. Above is the 
result. [0] Now could I use this in Bigbox? I have the data and using the API 
server to call for the latest data it’s quite possible I could implement some 
browser side code using D3. [1] You could debate the usefulness of this idea, 
what you can’t debate is having access to the data in the first place.

I’m looking into capturing the input data into Bigbox as you type per topic, 
allowing you to opportunity to try this. Bigbox is about text and data and this 
is one thing you have the opportunity to try.
