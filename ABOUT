  desc BIGBOX: A easy to use front end for socsim.


Abstract

    I was at a birthday party today, munching on some Pav, "Johnny Cash"
    was playing in the background and I whipped up a demo.

    It's called Big Box or 'bb' for short. An easy to use set of tools, 
    made accessible via a web browser.

Why?

    @geehall1 @peterrenshaw @SkillsyOz I will admit, it's all going past me - 
    the detail. I just rely on the finished product being usable.

    @peterrenshaw @SkillsyOz @tyabblemons The front-end sounds good...something 
    that helps the non-coders use this effectively.

    @peterrenshaw @SkillsyOz @geehall1 @tyabblemons Very good project, Peter, 
    though as a non-coder, it still reads semi-Greek to me.

What it is not

    At the moment I'm looking into creating something you download and 
run on your own PC via a browser as apposed to an online web service.


Explained quickly

browser.


How this will work

    A web page created in HTML has a JavaScript application embedded in the
page. The web page is served as a static page and the application reads data
from the file system. Interactivity between the application and data is done
via JavaScript. Any extra data processing is to be done via a Python program.

The web server requried can be as simple as standard calls to Python or a fully
functioning server such as Tornado. The JavaScript engine being looked at is 
Angular.

   Not decided but moving towards GPL 3. Have to consider any extra open source
code I use.

Comment: Brad Lemon - This structure more usable. A javascript app would be ideal. 
Just so long as the front end is dummy-proof.
